# This recipe installs the base environment needed for a WordPress site.
# In summary, it:
#
# 1. Installs the minimum required packages, which are:
#     - Apache2 (v 2.4)
#     - PHP (v7)
#     - PHP's MySQL connector
#
# 2. Makes sure the environment variables defined in the OpsWorks console are
#    readable in PHP.
#
# 3. Creates the Apache VirtualHost for the site. It uses the default template
#    which can be found in the `apache2` cookbook in this repo.
#
# This is all it does. Other considerations (such as giving it EFS support
# for multi-server setups or installing a MySQL/MariaDB server for single
# server setups) should be done in other recipes.
#
# The actual deployment of the application code is done in the `deploy` recipe,
# since we don't need to build the entire environment with each deploy.
#
# There are some considerations that should be taken into account with this
# recipe:
#
# a) It is intended solely for Opsworks, not for local installations.
# b) It has only been tested with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. It *should* work with other
#    operating systems, but it probably would take some additional work.

# Initial setup: just a couple vars we need

# 1. Installing some required packages
include_recipe 'apt::default'
include_recipe 'php::default'
include_recipe 'php::module_mysql'
include_recipe 'apache2::mod_php'

# 2. Set the environment variables for PHP

# 3. We create the site
